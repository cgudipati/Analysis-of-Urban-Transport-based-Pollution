# Analysis-of-Urban-Transport-based-Pollution

The basic idea of the project is to understand pollution levels caused by private commuting to and from places of edcuation/work.
This project arises amidst the global Coronavirus lockdown, which has turned skies blue and rivers clean.
Perhaps we can maintain this environmental health even after the lockdown.
This is a collection of the data and analysis methods that I have used for my research work.

##The following are the raw data files
*Urban Transport Emissions Reduction (Responses) - Form responses 1   (PDF)
*Urban Transport Emissions Reduction (Responses) (Excel)

##Procedure
*Raw data was taken from a Google Forms based survey.
*Raw data includes participants from India and England. A real world ratio has been used between participants in terms of tiers of cities.
*This data has been plotted and analyzed using general trends of pollutant emissions. There are files detailing on the methodologies and estimations used.
*The prime idea of the project is to analyze what happens to pollution levels if it becomes mandatory for everyone to live within 2 kilometers of their place of education/work.
